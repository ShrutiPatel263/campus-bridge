# 🎓 CampusBridge  
### Bridging the gap between juniors and placed seniors

CampusBridge is a **production-ready full-stack web platform** built to help students prepare for campus placements using **real interview experiences shared by placed seniors** — not guesswork, not random resources.

🚀 **Live Product**: https://campus-bridge-vgec.vercel.app  
👥 **10+ active real users and growing**

## 📌 Why CampusBridge?

As a student, I noticed a major problem in campus placements:

- Juniors don’t know **what companies actually ask**
- Preparation is often **unfocused and random**
- Real interview experiences are scattered across WhatsApp groups or lost completely
- Seniors want to help, but there’s **no structured platform**

**CampusBridge solves this by creating a single, open platform where experience turns into guidance.**
